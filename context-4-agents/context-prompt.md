SIVANA  
System Intelligence EV for Location Analytics of SPKLU and SPBKLU National

SIVANA is a web based planning tool with two main pages only, designed to stay simple but powerful:

1. Intelligence Planner

2. Projects

The idea is that everything starts in Intelligence Planner, then anything worth keeping is saved as a Project, whether it is just one station or a small network.

## **1\. Intelligence Planner**

Role of this page  
 Intelligence Planner is the main working canvas. This is where users explore data, work with the map and 3D view, and ask SIVANA’s analytics and AI to evaluate specific locations.

Typical things users do on this page

1. Set the analysis context  
    The user picks a focus area, for example one city, a toll road segment, or a tourism zone. They also choose what they want to achieve, such as finding the best single site for a new SPKLU, comparing a few candidate sites in one corridor, or checking whether an area is underserved.

2. Explore the map and 3D model  
    The central element of this page is an interactive map. The user can:

   * see existing SPKLU and SPBKLU in the selected area

   * turn on data layers such as potential EV users, points of interest like malls, campuses, or rest areas, and basic information about grid capacity

   * switch to a 3D city view that shows roads, buildings, and candidate stations as simple 3D objects

3. The 3D view helps make the decision tangible. For example, the planner can see if a candidate SPKLU site is actually close to parking access, toll entrances, or station platforms, rather than only seeing a dot on a flat map.

4. Select and analyse a location  
    When the user clicks on a point on the map or draws a small area, SIVANA runs a location analysis and shows:

   * estimated charging demand at that location

   * a recommendation for the type of infrastructure, SPKLU, SPBKLU, or a mix of both

   * a quick view of nearby grid readiness, for example whether the closest substation has enough spare capacity

   * a simple financial estimate such as rough investment size, potential utilisation, and indicative payback period

   * an overall suitability score so it is easy to compare locations

5. Alongside the numbers, SIVANA provides a short AI generated explanation, such as why this location scores well, what its main risks are, and how it compares with nearby alternatives.

6. Save analysis results as a Project  
    Once the user finds a location that looks promising, they can save it into a Project directly from this page.

    Examples:

   * If the user only wants to propose one new SPKLU, they create a Project called “SPKLU Rest Area KM 88” and attach that single location.

   * If they want to compare three candidate sites in one city, they create a Project for that city and add those three sites.

In short, Intelligence Planner is where users:

* explore spatial and grid data  
* move between 2D and 3D views  
* use analytics and AI insight  
* send chosen locations to the Projects page when they are ready to formalise them

## **2\. Projects**

Role of this page  
 Projects is the place where users organise and package what they found in Intelligence Planner. One Project can be very small, for example a single SPKLU proposal, or larger, such as a small cluster of sites in a district. The flow does not assume every user is building a huge national masterplan.

How Projects works

1. One Project equals one case or proposal  
    Some possible examples:  
   * “SPKLU Rest Area KM 88” with only one candidate site  
   * “SPBKLU Cluster for Delivery Riders in District X” with a few small sites  
   * “Pilot SPKLU Network for City Y 2028” with several strategic sites  
2. For each Project, SIVANA shows:  
   * the list of locations included, each with its suitability score and core metrics  
   * a small summary, such as total estimated investment, mix of SPKLU and SPBKLU, and simple access coverage indicators  
3. View and compare locations within a Project  
    Inside a Project, the user can:  
   * see each candidate site and its analysis, side by side  
   * view a simple comparison chart or ranking  
   * jump back to Intelligence Planner to re open any site on the map and 3D view if they need to tweak assumptions  
4. If the Project only contains one site, this still works as a clean “profile” of that location, ready for internal review or submission.  
5. Turn a Project into a short report  
    From Projects, SIVANA can generate a concise report for each Project that includes:  
   * a short description of the objective, for example “to select a technically and financially viable site for one SPKLU in Rest Area KM 88”  
   * a brief explanation of the data and factors considered  
   * the list of sites in the Project, if there is more than one, and a clear indication of which one is recommended  
   * supporting visuals such as a small map snapshot or an image from the 3D view taken from Intelligence Planner  
6. This report can be exported or copied into documents for management, government meetings, or investor pitches.  
7. Act as a decision and history log  
    Over time, Projects becomes the record of decisions. Users can see:  
   * Projects that have already been approved and built  
   * Projects still in study  
   * notes or decisions, for example “Site B rejected due to grid upgrade cost” or “Site A selected for phase one”

With this flow, SIVANA works well for both small and larger use cases:

* For a simple one station proposal  
  1. use Intelligence Planner to analyse one location  
  2. save it into a new single site Project  
  3. open Projects and export a short report.  
* For a multi site plan  
  1. explore and analyse several locations in Intelligence Planner  
  2. group them into one Project  
  3. compare, refine, and export the report from Projects.
